# Temp_Converter

## Overview
This is a **Temperature Converter** application built using Java with a Graphical User Interface (GUI). It allows users to convert temperatures between Celsius, Fahrenheit, and Kelvin. The project provides a simple interface for easy temperature conversion, making it accessible for users with no technical background.

## Features
- Convert temperatures between **Celsius**, **Fahrenheit**, and **Kelvin**.
- User-friendly **Graphical User Interface (GUI)** built with Java Swing.
- Input and output fields for entering temperature values and displaying results.
- Option to clear the input fields for a new conversion.
- Error handling for invalid input to ensure a smooth user experience.

## Technologies Used
- **Java**: The programming language used for building the application.
- **Swing**: Java's GUI toolkit used to create the graphical user interface.
- **SublineText or Eclipse IDE**: Recommended development environments.

## Requirements
- Java 8 or above.
- No external libraries are required.

## Installation
1. Clone this repository to your local machine:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/manishdahake10/TemperatureConverter.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd TemperatureConverter
    ```

3. Compile the `TC.java` file:
